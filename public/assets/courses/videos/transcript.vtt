00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.910
There's so much information and so many

2
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.930
ideas flying around the world of sales

3
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.980
training these days particularly around

4
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:06.970
the basics.

5
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.840
And so I think that there are different

6
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.080
levels of basic right?

7
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.220
There's the real Basics.

8
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.970
Like how do you look someone in the eye

9
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.520
and shake their hand that's not what I'm

10
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.030
talking about.

11
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.860
I'm talking about real hardcore sales

12
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.880
training Basics.

13
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.120
We're going to assume that you're already

14
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.550
a human being who knows how to make eye

15
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.520
contact who knows how to smile and all

16
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.790
that.

17
00:00:27.085 --> 00:00:29.895
I'm talking about what do you do to get in

18
00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:32.685
front of your ideal prospects?

19
00:00:32.905 --> 00:00:34.495
And what do you do once you're actually in

20
00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:37.635
front of them to really maximize the

21
00:00:37.635 --> 00:00:39.335
likelihood that you're actually going to

22
00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:40.865
close the sale.

23
00:00:41.095 --> 00:00:43.215
It's so important to get these little

24
00:00:43.215 --> 00:00:43.905
pieces, right?

25
00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:45.705
So in this video, I'm going to show you

26
00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:48.255
the 11 sales training Basics that

27
00:00:48.255 --> 00:00:51.205
beginners must Master check it out.

28
00:00:53.485 --> 00:00:56.245
Number one what you've been told before is

29
00:00:56.245 --> 00:00:56.475
wrong.

30
00:00:56.715 --> 00:00:59.725
I promise you that this is the case

31
00:00:59.755 --> 00:01:02.305
whatever someone has told you in the past

32
00:01:02.305 --> 00:01:04.285
about what you should be doing in sales is

33
00:01:04.285 --> 00:01:08.865
probably wrong now unless that person is a

34
00:01:09.134 --> 00:01:12.414
really badass sales manager or sales

35
00:01:12.414 --> 00:01:14.905
person who knows everything about selling

36
00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:18.105
if you're just going based off what most

37
00:01:18.105 --> 00:01:20.725
sales people think or what most managers

38
00:01:20.725 --> 00:01:22.185
think are even quite frankly what.

39
00:01:22.605 --> 00:01:25.485
CEOs think about sales that stuff is

40
00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:25.895
wrong.

41
00:01:26.235 --> 00:01:28.655
There is so much old school crap out there

42
00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:32.465
that if you just commit to doing the

43
00:01:32.565 --> 00:01:35.575
opposite of what most people are telling

44
00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:37.595
you you're going to be way better off.

45
00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:39.185
But of course, what you really want to do

46
00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:41.195
is go so much deeper and understand

47
00:01:41.195 --> 00:01:43.875
exactly what truly does work in selling

48
00:01:44.235 --> 00:01:47.305
number to be the complete opposite of what

49
00:01:47.305 --> 00:01:49.565
you think a salesperson is this builds off

50
00:01:49.565 --> 00:01:51.935
of that first idea, which is that most of.

51
00:01:51.985 --> 00:01:55.015
Of what the media and popular culture and

52
00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:57.175
quite frankly our professions tell us what

53
00:01:57.175 --> 00:02:00.285
a salesperson really is is wrong thinking

54
00:02:00.285 --> 00:02:04.055
of the gregarious back-slapping funny guy

55
00:02:04.055 --> 00:02:07.125
or gal as the archetypal salesperson is

56
00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:09.525
just silly in today's world.

57
00:02:09.725 --> 00:02:12.115
What makes an effective sales person is

58
00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.625
someone who can read people who can follow

59
00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:17.155
a process who can engage people in a

60
00:02:17.155 --> 00:02:20.585
conversation using a systematic approach.

61
00:02:20.895 --> 00:02:23.305
Being the opposite of what you think the

62
00:02:23.405 --> 00:02:26.235
average sales person is is so key because

63
00:02:26.235 --> 00:02:28.085
those people are actually hurting their

64
00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:31.305
own sales number 3 talk is cheap most

65
00:02:31.305 --> 00:02:33.845
sales people think that having The Gift of

66
00:02:33.845 --> 00:02:35.945
Gab is the best thing that we can all have

67
00:02:35.945 --> 00:02:37.935
when it comes to selling but the reality

68
00:02:37.935 --> 00:02:40.595
is is that your prospects don't want to

69
00:02:40.595 --> 00:02:41.715
hear you talk.

70
00:02:41.855 --> 00:02:42.965
They don't care about you.

71
00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:44.485
They don't care about your product.

72
00:02:44.785 --> 00:02:46.345
They don't care about your company and

73
00:02:46.345 --> 00:02:48.935
they certainly don't care about whatever

74
00:02:49.225 --> 00:02:50.505
BS you or another.

75
00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:53.085
Salesperson has to say about all of those

76
00:02:53.085 --> 00:02:55.465
different topics combined into one what

77
00:02:55.465 --> 00:02:57.565
they care about is solving the challenges

78
00:02:57.815 --> 00:03:01.475
that they are dealing with right now so us

79
00:03:01.655 --> 00:03:04.575
doing all this talking is just a waste of

80
00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:04.895
time.

81
00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:05.755
They don't care.

82
00:03:06.015 --> 00:03:07.925
Well we need to do is engage them in a

83
00:03:07.955 --> 00:03:11.635
conversation a two-way conversation where

84
00:03:11.665 --> 00:03:13.675
they're seeing value that we're providing

85
00:03:13.675 --> 00:03:15.965
but at the same time they're sharing

86
00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:19.385
insight into what they most care about

87
00:03:19.805 --> 00:03:20.245
get.

88
00:03:20.305 --> 00:03:22.755
Prospects talking in a way that they're

89
00:03:22.755 --> 00:03:24.905
really engaged in the conversation and

90
00:03:24.905 --> 00:03:26.975
then you're going to start closing so many

91
00:03:26.975 --> 00:03:30.605
more sales number for have a system as a

92
00:03:30.605 --> 00:03:32.595
relatively newer salesperson.

93
00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:34.545
One of the best things that you can do is

94
00:03:34.545 --> 00:03:38.775
have a real selling system to follow if

95
00:03:38.775 --> 00:03:41.425
you're just making it up as you go you are

96
00:03:41.425 --> 00:03:44.015
shooting yourself in the foot follow a

97
00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.975
systematic approach to selling whether

98
00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:47.625
it's my Approach or someone else's

99
00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:47.935
approach.

100
00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:49.975
I don't really care but what I care.

101
00:03:50.055 --> 00:03:51.425
You have a system.

102
00:03:51.795 --> 00:03:53.585
Obviously you want to have a system that

103
00:03:53.585 --> 00:03:55.585
has been proven to work in today's world,

104
00:03:55.585 --> 00:03:57.745
but have that systematic approach so that

105
00:03:57.745 --> 00:03:59.445
way you're not thinking next time you're

106
00:03:59.445 --> 00:04:00.125
in front of a prospect.

107
00:04:00.155 --> 00:04:01.545
What am I going to say next or what

108
00:04:01.545 --> 00:04:03.465
question am I going to ask or jeez?

109
00:04:03.495 --> 00:04:05.165
I wish I knew what I should be doing this

110
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.965
situation when you have a system, you know

111
00:04:06.965 --> 00:04:08.435
exactly what you need to do.

112
00:04:08.465 --> 00:04:09.615
Next number five.

113
00:04:09.685 --> 00:04:12.285
Do your homework show your prospects

114
00:04:12.315 --> 00:04:14.825
through personalization that you

115
00:04:14.865 --> 00:04:16.995
understand who they are that you've done

116
00:04:16.995 --> 00:04:17.644
your research.

117
00:04:17.685 --> 00:04:19.075
Now this doesn't mean that before you make

118
00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:19.655
every phone.

119
00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:21.725
You need to do 25 minutes of research, of

120
00:04:21.725 --> 00:04:22.955
course not at our company.

121
00:04:22.985 --> 00:04:24.425
We have a team of people who do our

122
00:04:24.425 --> 00:04:25.355
research for us.

123
00:04:25.525 --> 00:04:28.165
And so that way we have it ready to go and

124
00:04:28.165 --> 00:04:29.615
we don't actually have to do the research

125
00:04:29.615 --> 00:04:31.335
but we're showing we did our homework, but

126
00:04:31.335 --> 00:04:32.805
you want to know things about their

127
00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:34.305
company you want to know things about

128
00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:34.685
them.

129
00:04:34.715 --> 00:04:36.365
You want to know about their background

130
00:04:36.365 --> 00:04:38.015
about what they care about articles that

131
00:04:38.015 --> 00:04:40.765
they've shared so many of the key ways

132
00:04:40.765 --> 00:04:42.345
that you can do your homework are all

133
00:04:42.345 --> 00:04:44.665
within LinkedIn ideally using LinkedIn

134
00:04:44.665 --> 00:04:45.205
Navigator.

135
00:04:45.235 --> 00:04:47.615
You can get so much valuable information

136
00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:49.255
and insight on your prospects.

137
00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:51.965
Just by spending a couple of minutes

138
00:04:51.965 --> 00:04:53.925
really looking through their profile

139
00:04:53.965 --> 00:04:56.435
understanding what they most care about

140
00:04:56.435 --> 00:04:58.345
number six ask questions.

141
00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.295
Now, of course not all questions are

142
00:05:00.295 --> 00:05:00.995
created equal.

143
00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:02.875
So it doesn't mean just ask any questions

144
00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:05.165
but within a systematic approach you need

145
00:05:05.165 --> 00:05:06.895
to be asking questions and you need to be

146
00:05:06.895 --> 00:05:09.465
engaging your prospects getting them doing

147
00:05:09.465 --> 00:05:10.215
the talking if.

148
00:05:10.695 --> 00:05:12.465
You are doing all the talking in a selling

149
00:05:12.555 --> 00:05:14.825
situation, which is quite often the case

150
00:05:14.825 --> 00:05:16.095
for a lot of salespeople.

151
00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:16.755
You're in trouble.

152
00:05:17.005 --> 00:05:19.035
The data shows that top performing sales

153
00:05:19.035 --> 00:05:21.325
people are doing a lot more digging are

154
00:05:21.355 --> 00:05:25.325
asking valuable insightful questions to

155
00:05:25.355 --> 00:05:28.095
determine whether there's fit ask more

156
00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:31.105
questions number 7 don't be afraid to lose

157
00:05:31.175 --> 00:05:31.645
sales.

158
00:05:31.675 --> 00:05:34.495
I find that so many sales people are

159
00:05:34.845 --> 00:05:37.175
terrified with the idea of losing a sale

160
00:05:37.405 --> 00:05:37.975
and you know what?

161
00:05:38.075 --> 00:05:38.935
It happens.

162
00:05:39.275 --> 00:05:40.005
It's not a.

163
00:05:40.055 --> 00:05:42.945
Deal, I lose sales any top performing

164
00:05:43.015 --> 00:05:44.495
sales person loses sales.

165
00:05:44.895 --> 00:05:47.145
It's not the end of the world and quite

166
00:05:47.315 --> 00:05:50.615
frankly living in fear of losing a sale is

167
00:05:50.615 --> 00:05:52.755
going to make you so much weaker so much

168
00:05:52.945 --> 00:05:56.305
softer with a prospect and what you need

169
00:05:56.305 --> 00:05:58.405
to be is you need to be completely

170
00:05:58.405 --> 00:06:00.655
unafraid of losing a sale and when you're

171
00:06:00.695 --> 00:06:02.345
actually unafraid of losing a sale your

172
00:06:02.345 --> 00:06:04.755
prospect immediately feels it they don't

173
00:06:04.755 --> 00:06:07.945
feel creeped out by a sales person who

174
00:06:07.945 --> 00:06:09.705
clearly needs to close the sale and.

175
00:06:09.805 --> 00:06:12.605
Pay their rent being unafraid of losing

176
00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:14.285
sales is going to make you so much

177
00:06:14.445 --> 00:06:18.065
stronger in your selling number 8 B appear

178
00:06:18.095 --> 00:06:19.015
not a servant.

179
00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.225
There are so many sales people that feel

180
00:06:21.225 --> 00:06:23.655
like they need to put prospects up on a

181
00:06:23.785 --> 00:06:25.855
pedestal what they're really doing is not

182
00:06:25.855 --> 00:06:27.905
putting the prospect on the pedestal but

183
00:06:27.905 --> 00:06:30.285
they're actually getting down and they're

184
00:06:30.285 --> 00:06:32.725
bowing down like you would expect the

185
00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:33.865
servant in a movie.

186
00:06:33.895 --> 00:06:36.265
We need to be in a position where we see

187
00:06:36.265 --> 00:06:38.805
ourselves as true peers to our prospects,

188
00:06:39.195 --> 00:06:39.505
so.

189
00:06:39.585 --> 00:06:41.775
Don't treat your prospects like they're

190
00:06:42.395 --> 00:06:45.225
super special person and they need to be

191
00:06:45.225 --> 00:06:48.275
treated like a god or a goddess instead

192
00:06:48.665 --> 00:06:50.035
talk to them like a pier.

193
00:06:50.415 --> 00:06:54.535
I mean don't be overly casual and callous

194
00:06:54.705 --> 00:06:57.105
and curse and do these things necessarily

195
00:06:57.105 --> 00:07:00.065
but you want to talk to them as if they're

196
00:07:00.065 --> 00:07:01.945
just another person someone who puts on

197
00:07:01.945 --> 00:07:05.085
their pants one leg at a time when you

198
00:07:05.085 --> 00:07:07.515
behave like a peer to your prospects

199
00:07:07.825 --> 00:07:09.115
prospects feel that.

200
00:07:09.305 --> 00:07:10.875
It's disarming and it makes them more

201
00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:14.585
comfortable being that peer not a servant

202
00:07:14.715 --> 00:07:17.565
number 9 stop persuading your prospects do

203
00:07:17.565 --> 00:07:19.965
not need to be persuaded to do business

204
00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:20.315
with you.

205
00:07:20.365 --> 00:07:22.995
What they need is a professional

206
00:07:23.085 --> 00:07:25.215
salesperson who will determine whether

207
00:07:25.215 --> 00:07:25.685
there's a.

208
00:07:27.325 --> 00:07:29.895
. Your prospects either need or do not

209
00:07:29.895 --> 00:07:30.905
need what you have.

210
00:07:30.935 --> 00:07:33.005
There's no way to persuade someone who

211
00:07:33.005 --> 00:07:35.765
doesn't need what you have to buy what you

212
00:07:35.765 --> 00:07:37.095
have that's stupid.

213
00:07:37.285 --> 00:07:38.275
That's just dumb.

214
00:07:38.595 --> 00:07:39.635
It doesn't make sense.

215
00:07:40.055 --> 00:07:42.645
Don't try to persuade your prospects to do

216
00:07:42.645 --> 00:07:45.365
business with you instead engage them in a

217
00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:46.145
conversation.

218
00:07:46.295 --> 00:07:50.195
Ask them powerful youthful systematic

219
00:07:50.195 --> 00:07:53.225
questions to determine what's going on in

220
00:07:53.225 --> 00:07:53.635
their world.

221
00:07:53.665 --> 00:07:54.855
What are the challenges?

222
00:07:54.885 --> 00:07:55.425
What are the.

223
00:07:55.485 --> 00:07:57.405
Concerns that they are having what are the

224
00:07:57.405 --> 00:07:59.125
goals that are most important that they

225
00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:01.175
accomplished when you get to those

226
00:08:01.175 --> 00:08:03.925
questions and then weave in what it is

227
00:08:03.925 --> 00:08:06.115
you're selling now, you never have to be

228
00:08:06.455 --> 00:08:08.615
persuading someone or convincing someone

229
00:08:08.615 --> 00:08:10.235
to do business with you doing business

230
00:08:10.235 --> 00:08:11.625
with you is just going to be a natural

231
00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:13.675
extension of them solving their problems.

232
00:08:14.235 --> 00:08:16.955
Stop persuading number 10 always be

233
00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:21.535
learning learning is a lifelong journey if

234
00:08:21.535 --> 00:08:23.835
you stop learning you're in trouble.

235
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.280
And with sales so much is changing that

236
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.920
the second we stop learning.

237
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.850
We just immediately get ourselves into

238
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.670
trouble at our company.

239
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.419
We're always reading new books new

240
00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:37.959
strategies implementing new courses new

241
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.200
ideas always be learning new ideas,

242
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.320
especially if you're relatively new in

243
00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:43.669
sales.

244
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.180
You need to really Master selling if

245
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.890
you're here for real and you're doing this

246
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.560
in this is something that you are

247
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.320
committed to doing over the long term.

248
00:08:53.905 --> 00:08:56.535
Always be learning read new books on

249
00:08:56.535 --> 00:08:58.834
selling read new books on business.

250
00:08:59.474 --> 00:09:02.625
Take courses educate yourself on your

251
00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:03.344
craft.

252
00:09:03.375 --> 00:09:03.844
Think about it.

253
00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:05.635
If you were a lawyer you would have had to

254
00:09:05.635 --> 00:09:09.115
go to three or four years of law school.

255
00:09:09.375 --> 00:09:11.324
And then you have continuing education

256
00:09:11.324 --> 00:09:12.645
credits in sales.

257
00:09:13.165 --> 00:09:14.045
There's no such thing.

258
00:09:14.084 --> 00:09:17.074
So it's on us to continually be learning

259
00:09:17.104 --> 00:09:20.035
and getting better always be learning

260
00:09:20.194 --> 00:09:22.235
number 11 never get comfortable.

261
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.240
Ever the second you get comfortable with

262
00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.600
where you are is when you get into

263
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.700
trouble, I see this in the life cycle of

264
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.910
sales people all the time.

265
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:31.720
You see someone who comes out the gate and

266
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.510
they're actually doing really well and

267
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.190
then they start to make money and then

268
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.810
they feel really good and they start to

269
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:37.570
get comfortable.

270
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.530
And so what do they do?

271
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.490
They stop doing what it was they were

272
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.740
doing that got them to where they were and

273
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.120
then they get themselves into trouble.

274
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.150
We never want to get ourselves to the

275
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.780
point where we're super comfortable.

276
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.390
We always want to be a little

277
00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.300
uncomfortable a little.

278
00:09:51.935 --> 00:09:53.055
We're going to be looking over our

279
00:09:53.055 --> 00:09:55.725
shoulder thinking okay, if I stop doing

280
00:09:55.725 --> 00:09:57.885
what I'm doing, this is all going to fall

281
00:09:57.885 --> 00:09:58.865
apart now.

282
00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:01.125
I don't mean that in a way where we want

283
00:10:01.125 --> 00:10:03.755
to be paranoid, but we never want to get

284
00:10:03.755 --> 00:10:05.325
completely comfortable.

285
00:10:05.565 --> 00:10:07.865
We want to constantly be pushing to be

286
00:10:07.865 --> 00:10:09.945
striving to stretch outside of our comfort

287
00:10:09.945 --> 00:10:12.685
zone to try things that we haven't tried

288
00:10:12.685 --> 00:10:15.355
before the second we get comfortable is

289
00:10:15.355 --> 00:10:17.665
the second that we start to get worse.

00:10:17.935 --> 00:10:20.825
