What is a website? A website is
a collection of related web pages,

00:00:10.615 --> 00:00:15.355
including multimedia content typically
identified with a common domain name,

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.280
and published on at
least one web server.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.000
In its bare form, a website is
a single domain that consists

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.115
of different web
pages. Web page is

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:30.755
a document which can be displayed
in a web browser such as Firefox,

00:00:31.455 --> 00:00:36.420
Google Chrome, Opera, Microsoft
Edge, or Apple safari.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.060
These are also often
called as pages.

00:00:40.215 --> 00:00:44.395
Web server, a computer that hosts
a website of the internet.

00:00:45.975 --> 00:00:49.890
Web sites can be created and
maintained by an individual group

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.650
business or organization to
serve a variety of purposes.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.605
However, business owners may
know what a website is but some

00:00:58.605 --> 00:01:02.785
of them are not familiar or
unaware of the benefits a website

00:01:02.925 --> 00:01:04.625
can provide for
their business.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.770
Without a website, the business
can lose great opportunities.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.605
It is because a website itself
can be used to accomplish many

00:01:13.605 --> 00:01:16.825
different marketing strategies
to help the business grow.

00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:20.105
